# Database Schema Fixes

## 🔍 **Issues Identified from Server Logs**

Based on the development server errors, these are the missing database elements:

### **Missing Tables:**

1. ❌ `equipment` - Equipment management (exists in schema but not in DB)
2. ❌ `crop_rotation_plans` - Crop rotation planning (exists in schema but not in DB)
3. ❌ `tillage_operations` - Land preparation operations (exists in schema but not in DB)

### **Missing Columns:**

1. ❌ `tillage_operations.preparationPlanId` - Link to preparation plans

### **API Errors Found:**

- `GET /api/land-preparation/equipment` → "The table `public.equipment` does not exist"
- `GET /api/planning/pre-season` → "The table `public.crop_rotation_plans` does not exist"
- `GET /api/land-preparation/tillage-operations` → "The column `tillage_operations.preparationPlanId` does not exist"

## 🛠️ **Solution**

The schema exists but the database hasn't been migrated. Need to run Prisma migrations to create the missing tables.
