# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Horticulture Farm Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to help farmers plan, track, and manage their farming operations efficiently. The system will provide tools for managing planting schedules, irrigation, fertilization, pest control, harvesting, and inventory management. Built with TypeScript and Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database, the system will offer a RESTful API architecture with strong type safety and comprehensive CRUD operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to register and authenticate into the system, so that I can securely access my farm management data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide fields for username, email, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to login
3. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to the dashboard
4. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain the session securely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to create and manage crop profiles, so that I can track different crops I'm growing on my farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the crop management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing crop profiles
2. WHEN a user creates a new crop profile THEN the system SHALL require crop name, variety, planting date, and expected harvest date
3. WHEN a user updates a crop profile THEN the system SHALL save the changes and update the display
4. WHEN a user deletes a crop profile THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database and confirm the action
5. WHEN displaying crop profiles THEN the system SHALL show crop status, growth stage, and days to harvest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to plan and track daily and seasonal farming tasks, so that I can stay organized and ensure timely completion of farming activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the task planner THEN the system SHALL display a calendar view with scheduled tasks
2. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL require task name, description, due date, and associated crop
3. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status and record completion date
4. WHEN a user views upcoming tasks THEN the system SHALL display tasks sorted by priority and due date
5. WHEN a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL highlight it with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to log and track irrigation and fertilization activities, so that I can maintain optimal growing conditions and comply with best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the irrigation log THEN the system SHALL display a history of irrigation events
2. WHEN a user records an irrigation event THEN the system SHALL capture date, duration, water amount, and affected crops
3. WHEN a user logs fertilizer application THEN the system SHALL record fertilizer type, amount, application method, and target crops
4. WHEN viewing fertilization history THEN the system SHALL display chronological records with crop associations
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total water usage and fertilizer consumption per crop

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to track pest and disease occurrences, so that I can monitor crop health and take preventive measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reports a pest issue THEN the system SHALL record pest type, severity level, affected area, and treatment applied
2. WHEN a user logs a disease occurrence THEN the system SHALL capture disease type, symptoms, affected crops, and treatment plan
3. WHEN viewing pest/disease history THEN the system SHALL display trends and patterns over time
4. WHEN a critical issue is reported THEN the system SHALL flag it for immediate attention
5. WHEN generating health reports THEN the system SHALL summarize pest/disease incidents by crop and time period

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to record harvest data and track yields, so that I can measure productivity and plan for future seasons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user records a harvest THEN the system SHALL capture harvest date, quantity, quality grade, and associated crop
2. WHEN viewing harvest records THEN the system SHALL display yield data organized by crop and time period
3. WHEN calculating yields THEN the system SHALL compute yield per area and compare to expected yields
4. WHEN generating harvest reports THEN the system SHALL provide summaries and analytics on productivity
5. WHEN tracking inventory THEN the system SHALL update available quantities based on harvest and sales data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to view a comprehensive dashboard with analytics, so that I can get insights into my farm's performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators and metrics
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show charts for yield trends, resource usage, and task completion rates
3. WHEN accessing the calendar view THEN the system SHALL display upcoming tasks, harvest dates, and important events
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable summaries of farm activities and performance
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for smaller screens

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to provide a robust RESTful API, so that data can be reliably managed and the system can integrate with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate input data using TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency
5. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL record API usage and system events for monitoring
