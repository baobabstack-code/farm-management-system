# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the farming app by implementing comprehensive individual detail pages for all existing entities. Currently, the app has basic listing and some edit functionality, but lacks complete detail views and delete operations. This enhancement will provide users with full visibility into their farm data and complete management capabilities for crops, fields, equipment, and other farm entities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to view detailed information about individual crops, so that I can make informed decisions about crop management and track performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a crop from the crops list THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive crop detail page
2. WHEN viewing a crop detail page THEN the system SHALL show crop name, variety, planting date, expected harvest date, current growth stage, and health status
3. WHEN viewing a crop detail page THEN the system SHALL display associated field information and location data
4. WHEN viewing a crop detail page THEN the system SHALL show historical data including previous yields and treatment records
5. IF the crop has associated images THEN the system SHALL display them in a gallery format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to view detailed information about individual fields, so that I can monitor field conditions and manage field-specific activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a field from the fields list THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive field detail page
2. WHEN viewing a field detail page THEN the system SHALL show field name, size, location coordinates, soil type, and current status
3. WHEN viewing a field detail page THEN the system SHALL display all crops currently planted in the field
4. WHEN viewing a field detail page THEN the system SHALL show field history including previous crops and treatments
5. IF the field has boundary coordinates THEN the system SHALL display a map visualization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to delete crops, fields, and equipment that are no longer needed, so that I can keep my farm data clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on a detail page THEN the system SHALL provide a delete option with appropriate permissions
2. WHEN a user initiates a delete action THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with warning about data loss
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the entity and all associated data
4. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate listing page with a success message
5. IF an entity has dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show an informative error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to navigate seamlessly between related entities, so that I can efficiently manage interconnected farm data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a crop detail page THEN the system SHALL provide links to the associated field detail page
2. WHEN viewing a field detail page THEN the system SHALL provide links to all crops planted in that field
3. WHEN viewing equipment detail page THEN the system SHALL show usage history with links to related fields and crops
4. WHEN navigating between detail pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation patterns
5. WHEN on any detail page THEN the system SHALL provide breadcrumb navigation back to listing pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to perform quick actions from detail pages, so that I can efficiently manage my farm operations without excessive navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any detail page THEN the system SHALL provide quick action buttons for common operations
2. WHEN on a crop detail page THEN the system SHALL provide buttons to edit, delete, and record treatments
3. WHEN on a field detail page THEN the system SHALL provide buttons to edit, delete, and add new crops
4. WHEN on equipment detail page THEN the system SHALL provide buttons to edit, delete, and schedule maintenance
5. WHEN performing quick actions THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page context where appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to see activity timelines on detail pages, so that I can track the history and changes made to my farm entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any detail page THEN the system SHALL display a chronological activity timeline
2. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the system SHALL show creation date, last modified date, and major changes
3. WHEN viewing crop timeline THEN the system SHALL include planting, treatment, and harvest events
4. WHEN viewing field timeline THEN the system SHALL include crop rotations and field treatments
5. WHEN viewing equipment timeline THEN the system SHALL include maintenance records and usage logs
