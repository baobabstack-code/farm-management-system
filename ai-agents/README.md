## Getting Started

1. **Enable AI Features**: Add environment variables from `.env.ai` to your main `.env` file
2. **Install ADK**: Follow Google AI ADK installation guide
3. **Configure Agents**: Set up agent configurations in `config/`
4. **Test Locally**: Use ADK CLI to test agents before deployment

## Safety Features

- **Feature Flags**: All AI features are behind feature flags
- **Read-Only Access**: AI agents only read data, never modify existing records
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: UI components work even if AI features fail
- **User Control**: Users can disable AI features at any time

## Development Guidelines

1. **Non-Disruptive**: AI features must not break existing functionality
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Use feature flags for controlled deployment
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on AI recommendations
4. **Transparency**: Always explain AI decisions to users
5. **Privacy**: Respect user data and privacy preferences
